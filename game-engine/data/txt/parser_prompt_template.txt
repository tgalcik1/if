Twisted trees claw at the overcast sky, their leaves a sickly brown. A pervasive, unnatural fog slithers between gnarled roots and choking vines. Glimpses of the castle loom distantly through the mist, its spires a haunting silhouette against the grey light. The silence is oppressive; no birdsong or rustle of small creatures disturbs the air.

Buildings that were once elegant and proud are now crumbling facades, their stones eroded and scorched. The streets, once filled with the chatter and laughter of a busy populace, now echo with an eerie silence, occasionally broken by the distant shrieks of lurking ghouls.

Let us see whose will is stronger — your false god or the greatest dynasty to ever be. Meet thy fate upon my blade and join your silent congregation!'", items=[], characters=[]),
