The Kingdom of Tritica was once a flourishing haven under the rule of its beloved King and Queen, known for their compassion and devotion to the people. Blessed with fertile lands, glittering rivers, and fields brimming with golden crops, Tritica's prosperity was seen as the embodiment of the Goddess Lenia's favor. For years, the royal couple dreamed of an heir to carry on their legacy of peace and plenty, but despite their efforts, their hopes remained unfulfilled. Then, after a decade of patient waiting, joy filled the kingdom when news of the Queen's long-awaited pregnancy was announced-only for tragedy to strike as the child was lost.
The miscarriage shattered their lives and, as though a dark cloud settled over the realm, the people began to see changes in their once kindly rulers. The Queen fell into a hollow silence, retreating from the public eye as grief gnawed at her heart. The King, however, grew suspicious of his court, obsessed with the thought that unseen forces were conspiring against him and his dynasty. He tried to conceive another child through any means but failed to produce another heir. Driven by paranoia and grief, he lashed out, executing those he suspected of harboring ill will or disloyalty. He imposed a series of brutal laws, transforming Tritica's once-peaceful streets into a maze of curfews, patrols, and despair. Under his tyrannical grip, the thriving kingdom slowly unraveled as trade dwindled, crops withered, and the people's cries for mercy fell on deaf ears.
Yet even in the darkness, the people of Tritica clung to their faith in Lenia, the goddess who had blessed their lands. As the King descended further into madness, leaders of the Lenian Church begged him to restore peace and return to the light. In a final, desperate plea, they confronted him in his throne room, urging him to see the pain he had caused. But in a fit of fury, the King ordered the execution of each and every clergyman present, placing their severed heads on stakes as a grisly warning to all who would oppose his rule. The worship of Lenia was outlawed, and his soldiers spread across the capital and countryside, imprisoning any faithful who dared defy his command.
Chaos erupted across the kingdom, and rebellion loomed. But on the bloodiest day of Tritica's history, an ethereal figure descended into the throne room. It was Rimor, an angel of Lenia, sent to answer the prayers of Tritica's suffering children. With a voice that echoed like thunder, Rimor condemned the King, stripping the souls from all within the castle walls and twisting them into ghoulish, nightmarish wretches, forever bound to haunt the halls they once served. As Rimor spoke, a chilling curse fell upon Tritica: "The children of Tritica have cried out to me in anguish. Their blood is on your hands and they will have their retribution. This day of reckoning will mark the advent of your dynasty's downfall."
Years later, the kingdom remains cloaked in despair, and those cursed souls wander the castle's shadows, driven mad by the hunger for revenge. Amidst the misery, a humble farmer-a peasant marked by Rimor-stands at the graves of two loved ones, freshly buried outside his small village just beyond the kingdom's walls. Unknown to him, he is destined to end the curse and break the nightmare that has fallen over Tritica. With only his wits and the faintest hope, he sets out to challenge a corrupted dynasty, prepared to face the nightmares that lurk within the heart of Tritica's forsaken castle.
